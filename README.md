# Hi, Git
## I,m norman.
This is my first time to use git,and below are some code:

#`Hello word`

And now, I'll upload this readme.md file to server.

 Oh,forgot something? yeah~   this is first time to use MarkDown.
 
 When I start with # at a new line first char, the line will be a Title line.
 
and use ## is the sub title.

also can use `code here` .... ah... how to say `````` ???? and ??? shit~!
